# A music player visualizer
A music player with a library of music to play

## How it was made
I started out finding out what essential features I wanted and then
added all nice to have features to planned features.

used React to handle picking music to play, volume and seek. I used plain Javascript to craft a visualizer
using HTML canvas.
